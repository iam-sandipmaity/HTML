        Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
        <a href="https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4">
            download the MP4
        </a>
        and watch it with your favorite video player!

<!-- First Ogg is tried. If that can't be played, then AVI is tried. Finally, MP4 is tried. A fallback message is displayed if the video element isn't supported, but not if all sources fail. -->

<!-- Some media file types let you provide more specific information using the codecs parameter as part of the file's type string. A relatively simple example is video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis", which says that the file is a WebM video using VP8 for its video and Vorbis for audio. -->
